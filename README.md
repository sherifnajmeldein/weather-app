## 📌 Project Overview  
This project automates the deployment of a simple **Weather App** using **Jenkins, Ansible, Docker, and Vagrant**. The pipeline builds, deploys, and runs the application on two VMs using Ansible playbooks.  

---

## � Technologies Used  

- **Jenkins**: CI/CD automation  
- **Ansible**: Configuration management & deployment  
- **Docker**: Containerization  
- **Vagrant**: VM provisioning  
- **GitHub**: Version control  

---

## 📜 CI/CD Pipeline Workflow  

1. **Trigger Pipeline** – Jenkins fetches the latest code from GitHub  
2. **Build Stage** – Creates a Docker image  
3. **Push Image** – Uploads the image to Docker Hub  
4. **Deploy Stage** – Ansible provisions the VMs and runs the container

🔧 Setup & Deployment
1️⃣ Configure Vagrant Machines
Run the following to provision the VMs:

sh
Copy
vagrant up
2️⃣ Jenkins Pipeline Setup
In Jenkins, create a new pipeline job.

Add the Jenkinsfile to execute the pipeline.

3️⃣ Run the Ansible Playbook
sh
Copy
ansible-playbook -i ansible/inventory ansible/deploy.yaml
4️⃣ Access the Web App
Find the IPs of the two VMs and access them in your browser:

cpp
Copy
http://<vm1-ip>:5000  
http://<vm2-ip>:5000
